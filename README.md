**Foundations Landing Page**

This website was built as part of the Odin Project Foundations: Flexbox lesson in order to implement everything I've learned thus far about HTML, CSS, and the Flexbox layout method.

I learned a lot about proper workflow when creating a webpage. It was helpful first to write all of the content into the HTML file and commit this to Github. Then once everything was there, I moved onto the CSS, styling the background, text colors, and fonts; then styling font and button sizes, adding images and styling them.

Only once all of the elements were present and styled did I begin applying Flexbox to move the elements around into their approximate positions, tackling one or two sections at a time (the design of the webpage was broken up into 6 sections, which made it easy to do so), committing to Github once I had one or two sections in a good place. Once everything was styled and positioned roughly, I went back and tweaked any final touches.

After having gone through this process, I feel much more confident about how to create a webpage from scratch using HTML, CSS, and the Flexbox layout method.
